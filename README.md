# C-FishPlayStreetfighterImitation
This is uses the C++, openCV library to do color detection. It is meant to emulate the technology used in the Twitch stream "Fish Play Street Fighter." ( http://www.twitch.tv/fishplaystreetfighter ) Currently it is only a concept program. You can set it to track an object through your camera. When the object enters the top left of the panel, the computer will type "a". If I can get source code to a game I have big plans for this. I followed the following tutorial to learn the OpenCV library https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2b0kP6Hwc_R8ebv8P2f9w
